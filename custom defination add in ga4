Register Custom Dimensions in GA4
This is the most common mistake! Even if you send page_type or content_group from GTM, GA4 will ignore them in your reports unless you register them.

Open GA4 > Admin > Custom Definitions.

Click Create Custom Dimension.

Dimension name: Page Type

Scope: Event

Event parameter: page_type (must match exactly what you typed in GTM).

Repeat this for content_group and language.

Note: user_id does not need a custom dimension; GA4 has a built-in slot for it.

How to verify it's working:
Click Preview in GTM.

Visit your site.

In the Tag Assistant window, click on the Config or Page View event.

Check the API Call tab to see if page_type, user_id, etc., are listed in the "Values" section.
